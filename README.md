## üìä Implementation Details

### 1. Data Generation Module (`data_generator.py`)

The data generator creates realistic sample hospital data including:

- **Departments:** 10 hospital departments (General Medicine, Surgery, Cardiology, etc.)
- **Doctors:** 20 doctors with specializations and department assignments
- **Services:** 30+ medical services with costs and durations
- **Patients:** 30 sample patients with demographics
- **Appointments:** 2 years of appointment data (5-15 appointments per day)
- **Billing:** Complete billing records with payment status

#### Key Code Segments:

```python
def generate_sample_data():
    """Generate comprehensive sample data for Lanka Medical Center"""
    conn = sqlite3.connect('hospital_data.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    # Create tables
    create_tables(cursor)
    
    # Generate sample data
    departments = generate_departments()
    doctors = generate_doctors(departments)
    services = generate_services(departments)
    patients = generate_patients()
    appointments = generate_appointments(patients, doctors, services)
    billing = generate_billing(appointments)
    
    # Insert data into database
    insert_departments(cursor, departments)
    insert_doctors(cursor, doctors)
    insert_services(cursor, services)
    insert_patients(cursor, patients)
    insert_appointments(cursor, appointments)
    insert_billing(cursor, billing)
```

### 2. Analytics Engine (`analytics_engine.py`)

The analytics engine provides comprehensive data analysis capabilities through SQL queries and pandas operations.

#### Key Analytics Methods:

**Dashboard Overview:**
```python
def get_total_patients(self):
    """Get total number of patients"""
    query = "SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM patients"
    result = self._execute_query(query)
    return result['count'].iloc[0]

def get_total_revenue(self):
    """Get total revenue"""
    query = """
    SELECT COALESCE(SUM(b.amount), 0) as total_revenue
    FROM billing b
    JOIN appointments a ON b.appointment_id = a.appointment_id
    WHERE a.status = 'Completed' AND b.payment_status = 'Paid'
    """
    result = self._execute_query(query)
    return result['total_revenue'].iloc[0]
```

**Service Utilization Analysis:**
```python
def analyze_service_utilization(self):
    """Analyze service utilization patterns"""
    top_services_query = """
    SELECT 
        s.name as service_name,
        s.type as service_type,
        d.name as department_name,
        COUNT(a.appointment_id) as appointment_count,
        AVG(s.cost) as avg_cost,
        SUM(s.cost) as total_revenue
    FROM appointments a
    JOIN services s ON a.service_id = s.service_id
    JOIN departments d ON s.department_id = d.department_id
    WHERE a.status = 'Completed'
    GROUP BY s.service_id, s.name, s.type, d.name
    ORDER BY appointment_count DESC
    LIMIT 10
    """
    
    top_services = self._execute_query(top_services_query)
    return {'top_services': top_services}
```

**Doctor Performance Analysis:**
```python
def analyze_doctor_performance(self):
    """Analyze doctor performance metrics"""
    top_doctors_query = """
    SELECT 
        d.name as doctor_name,
        d.specialization,
        dept.name as department_name,
        COUNT(a.appointment_id) as appointments_handled,
        SUM(b.amount) as total_revenue,
        AVG(b.amount) as avg_revenue_per_appointment
    FROM appointments a
    JOIN doctors d ON a.doctor_id = d.doctor_id
    JOIN departments dept ON d.department_id = dept.department_id
    JOIN billing b ON a.appointment_id = b.appointment_id
    WHERE a.status = 'Completed' AND b.payment_status = 'Paid'
    GROUP BY d.doctor_id, d.name, d.specialization, dept.name
    ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
    LIMIT 10
    """
```

### 3. Main Application (`main.py`)

The main Streamlit application provides an interactive dashboard with:

- **Navigation sidebar** for different analysis modules
- **Date range selectors** for filtering data
- **Interactive visualizations** using Plotly
- **Real-time data updates** and caching

#### Key Features:

```python
# Sidebar navigation
module = st.sidebar.selectbox(
    "Select Analysis Module",
    ["Dashboard Overview", "Most Utilized Services", "Doctor Performance", 
     "Patient Trends", "Patient Behavior", "Billing & Revenue"]
)

# Date range selector
date_range = st.sidebar.date_input(
    "Select Date Range",
    value=(datetime.now() - timedelta(days=365), datetime.now()),
    max_value=datetime.now()
)

# Data caching for performance
@st.cache_data
def load_data():
    """Load or generate sample data for the application"""
    try:
        conn = sqlite3.connect('hospital_data.db')
        patients = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM patients", conn)
        conn.close()
        if len(patients) > 0:
            return True
    except:
        pass
    
    generate_sample_data()
    return True
```

### 4. Visualization Utilities (`visualization_utils.py`)

Provides helper functions for creating consistent and interactive charts:

```python
def create_revenue_trend_chart(data):
    """Create revenue trend chart"""
    fig = px.line(data, x='month', y='revenue', 
                  title='Monthly Revenue Trend',
                  labels={'month': 'Month', 'revenue': 'Revenue (Rs.)'})
    fig.update_layout(
        xaxis_title="Month",
        yaxis_title="Revenue (Rs.)",
        hovermode='x unified'
    )
    return fig

def create_doctor_performance_scatter(data):
    """Create doctor performance scatter plot"""
    fig = px.scatter(data, x='appointments_handled', y='revenue_generated',
                     size='patient_satisfaction', hover_data=['doctor_name'],
                     title='Doctor Performance: Appointments vs Revenue')
    fig.update_layout(
        xaxis_title="Appointments Handled",
        yaxis_title="Revenue Generated (Rs.)",
        hovermode='closest'
    )
    return fig
```
